# go-blackhole

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/bwalex/go-blackhole.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bwalex/go-blackhole)

go-blackhole watches the systemd journal for failed SSH login/authentication attempts and automatically blacklists these IPs for a fixed duration by adding a blackhole route.
